# [Attention Index](https://kaleida.github.io/attention-index/)

The Attention Index is a measurement standard that scores activity across the media ecosystem. The project was iniated by the team at [Kaleida](https://www.kaleida.com), a media research and data company based out of the UK.

## [Data](/data)

The data is available as CSVs in monthly batches. You can download the [full data](/data) and use it for your needs.

## [Methodology](/docs)

We've published [a summary and notes](/docs) about the approach used to identify the model. You are encouraged to apply our methodology to developing the Attention Index. Notes include information about what the data means, how it was collected and what we're doing with it.

You can also see the model exploration in detail via a [python jupyter notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/kaleida/attention-index/blob/master/data/attention-index.ipynb). That document goes step-by-step through our data explorations detailing how we arrived at these results. It includes the exploratory analysis, charts, data tables, statistics and the resulting formulas.


## Contributing

As a new project we have not yet worked through our contributing policies. But please do submit PRs and we'll do our best to respond quickly. More to come.
